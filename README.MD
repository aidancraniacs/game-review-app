--For mobile and desktop to work, APP.PY must be running in terminal & go to https://countryfied-imani-nonpsychical.ngrok-free.dev on the device of choice

-- Alot of the code and information comes from different yt videos based off the issues or features I wanted to implement/fix

-- I wanted to make the web app as high quality as I could, but I don't know much further than the standard components from the pwa tutorials

-- This should work on mobile and desktop, I tried on both and it was a success

-- I also use an extension that gives suggestions for clean and understandable comments for documentation (GitHub Copilot)
